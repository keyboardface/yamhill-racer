# Yamhill Racer

A low-poly open-world racing game set on real roads and forest trails in Yamhill County, Oregon —
from Willamina through the hills to Sheridan (about 10 × 8 km). Runs in the browser, no install.

**Play:** https://distractodog.github.io/yamhill-racer/

## Controls
| Key | |
|---|---|
| W / S or ↑ / ↓ | throttle / brake (and reverse) |
| A / D or ← / → | steer |
| Space | handbrake — tap it while steering to drift |
| R | back to a recent spot on the road |
| H | back to the Delphian campus |
| C | change camera |
| T | car tuning panel |

A gamepad works too (right trigger, left trigger, left stick, A for handbrake).

Watch out for the elk: a herd wanders onto the road wherever you are driving, and they are in no hurry to move.

## How the world is made
- **Ground** — USGS 3DEP lidar elevation.
- **Forest** — trees are placed wherever the canopy-height data says trees really are.
- **Roads, buildings, lakes** — OpenStreetMap, widened so they're raceable.
- **Trails** — traced from a hand-drawn trail map.
- The map is cut into 2 km tiles that stream in as you drive.

`tools/fetch_tiles.py` downloads the raw data per tile and `tools/build_tiles.py` bakes `game/assets/`.
`npm run drive` runs headless physics test drives. The game itself is plain ES modules + three.js (no build step):
serve `game/` with any static web server.
